# Phase 4 Implementation Plan: User Features

## Overview
Phase 4 completes the user-facing features of SoundDrop by implementing library management, sample uploads, and the upload page. The favorites system is already partially implemented but needs enhancement.

## Current Status
- ✅ Authentication system complete (Supabase Auth with Google OAuth)
- ✅ Favorites API endpoints and UI components exist
- ✅ Database schema fully defined
- ✅ Storage buckets configured in Supabase
- ✅ File validation utilities implemented
- ⚠️ My Libraries page exists but needs implementation
- ❌ Library management features not implemented
- ❌ Sample/icon upload functionality missing
- ❌ Upload page doesn't exist

## Implementation Tasks

- Rate limiting (10 uploads/hour)
- Progress tracking support

### 3. Library Management Components
**Files to create:**

- Responsive design

### 4. Upload Components
**Files to create:**
- `components/upload/audio-dropzone.tsx` - Drag & drop for audio
- `components/upload/icon-dropzone.tsx` - Drag & drop for images
- `components/upload/upload-progress.tsx` - Progress indicator
- `components/upload/file-preview.tsx` - Preview before upload

**Key Features:**
- Drag & drop interface
- File validation feedback
- Upload progress tracking
- Error handling
- Multiple file queue

### 5. Upload Page
**Files to create:**
- `app/(protected)/upload/page.tsx` - Main upload page
- `app/(protected)/upload/upload-form.tsx` - Upload form component

**Key Features:**
- Library selection
- Sample name input
- Audio file upload
- Batch upload support
- Success/error feedback

### 6. Hooks
**Files to create:**
- `hooks/use-libraries.ts` - Library management hook
- `hooks/use-upload.ts` - File upload hook

**Existing to enhance:**
- `hooks/use-favorites.ts` - Already exists, may need updates

### 7. UI Components (shadcn/ui)
**Components to add:**
- `button` - Action buttons
- `form` - Form handling
- `input` - Text inputs
- `label` - Form labels
- `select` - Dropdowns
- `textarea` - Descriptions
- `toast` - Notifications
- `progress` - Upload progress
- `alert-dialog` - Confirmations
- `dropdown-menu` - Actions menu
- `card` - Library cards
- `separator` - Visual dividers
- `skeleton` - Loading states
- `tabs` - Upload modes

### 8. Type Definitions
**Files to enhance:**
- `types/api.ts` - Create for API response types
- `types/upload.ts` - Create for upload-related types

### 9. Utility Functions
**Files to create:**
- `lib/audio-utils.ts` - Audio duration extraction
- `lib/upload-utils.ts` - Upload helpers
- `lib/rate-limit.ts` - Rate limiting logic

**Files to enhance:**
- `lib/utils.ts` - Add any missing utilities

## Implementation Order

### Step 1: Install Required shadcn/ui Components
```bash
npx shadcn@latest add button form input label select textarea toast progress alert-dialog dropdown-menu card separator skeleton tabs
```

### Step 2: Create Base API Endpoints
1. Implement `/api/libraries` endpoints
2. Implement `/api/upload` endpoints
3. Add proper error handling and validation

### Step 3: Build Library Management
1. Create library card component
2. Implement create library dialog
3. Add edit/delete functionality
4. Complete My Libraries page

### Step 4: Implement Upload System
1. Create dropzone components
2. Build upload form
3. Add progress tracking
4. Create upload page

### Step 5: Integration & Testing
1. Connect all components
2. Test upload flow end-to-end
3. Verify rate limiting
4. Test error scenarios

## Technical Considerations

### File Upload Architecture
```
Client → Validation → Upload to Supabase → Create DB Record → Return URL
```

### Rate Limiting Strategy
- Use in-memory store for development
- Consider Redis for production
- Track by user ID
- 10 uploads per hour limit

### Audio Duration Extraction
- Use Web Audio API on client
- Fallback to server-side extraction
- Store duration in database

### Storage Structure
```
audio-samples/
  └── {userId}/
      └── {sampleId}-{timestamp}.{ext}

library-icons/
  └── {userId}/
      └── {libraryId}-{timestamp}.{ext}
```

### Error Handling
- Client-side validation first
- Server-side validation as backup
- User-friendly error messages
- Retry logic for network errors

## Security Considerations
- Validate file types on server
- Enforce size limits
- Sanitize file names
- Check user authentication
- Verify library ownership
- Rate limit uploads
- Scan for malicious content (future)

## Performance Optimizations
- Lazy load library icons
- Implement virtual scrolling for large lists
- Cache library data
- Optimize image sizes
- Use CDN for static assets
- Implement pagination

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Create library with custom icon
- [ ] Edit library details
- [ ] Delete library (with confirmation)
- [ ] Upload single audio file
- [ ] Upload multiple audio files
- [ ] Handle large files (>50MB)
- [ ] Test rate limiting
- [ ] Verify file type restrictions
- [ ] Test error scenarios
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Keyboard navigation
- [ ] Screen reader compatibility

## Success Metrics
- Upload success rate > 95%
- Average upload time < 10s for 10MB file
- Library creation time < 2s
- Page load time < 1s
- Zero security vulnerabilities
- Full mobile compatibility
