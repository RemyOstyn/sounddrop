### 📱 Pages Implemented
1. **Home Page** (`/`): Hero section with stats, sample browsing, tab navigation
2. **Trending Page** (`/trending`): Time-period selector, trending samples
3. **Category Pages** (`/category/[slug]`): Category-specific browsing with stats
4. **Main Layout**: Sidebar + mobile nav integration

## 🛠 Technical Implementation

## 🎯 Design Highlights

### Glassmorphism Implementation
- `backdrop-filter: blur(40px)` for glass effects
- Semi-transparent backgrounds with subtle borders
- Layered depth with shadow and glow effects
- Hover states with increased opacity and transform

### Animation System
- Entrance animations with staggered delays
- Layout animations for view transitions
- Micro-interactions on hover and tap
- Smooth page transitions between routes

### Audio Experience
- Visual feedback during playback with animated waveforms
- Multiple simultaneous sample playback
